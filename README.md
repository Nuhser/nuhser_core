# Nuhser Core

### by Nuhser

<br>

This datapack is made for Minecraft 1.15 and above.  
You'll need it in order for any other nuhser-datapacks to work. It also contains some scoreboards which you can use to track stuff (e.g. distance walked) and a random-number-generator.

Here's a list of all nuhser-datapacks and their UNID (Unique-Nuhser-ID):
